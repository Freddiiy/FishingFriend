## About the bot

The bot will automaticly throw the lure in the water when needed, by pressing the key '4'. So from start you should put you fishing abillity at the fourth slot in you action bar.


The bot uses color recognition to look for both the the red feather on the bobber but also to detect when a catch is ready by looking for the color of the splash effect the game uses.

Even though the bot cant be detected by bot/tool detection systems, a player might be red flaged if standing still fishing for around 30 minutes. Therefore the bot will insure you saftly by doing a relog every 25 min which would reset the counter. 

## How to use the bot
